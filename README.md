*<figure> into <figcaption>....</figca...></fig...> allows you give a picture a caption
*Can place emphasis on a word using <em> element, more of an italic. The <strong> does the same but is in bold
*<form> creates a platform for the user to add information to. you give it an action element to indicate where that said information goes to.
e.g. <form action="/submit-url"></form>
*use <input>
to create the textbox for user info <input> is a void element. Can add an attributes to the <input>. 'Type' determines the way the text box appears
to the user, 'name' describes the type of information you will be collecting from said textbox, 'placeholder' gives the user hints as to what value to enter,
'required' makes the input mandatory
e.g<input type="text" name = "name" placeholder = "Your name" required>.
